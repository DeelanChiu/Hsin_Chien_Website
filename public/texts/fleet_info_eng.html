<p>One good representation of our business growth is the substantially development of our fleet over the years. Presently, we are controlling total of 25 vessels ranging from Capesize, Panamax to Handymax and Small Handy. Long-term time charter contracts
    of our vessels provide a steady and secure base to expand our own chartering and operation business. We are operating several our own small handy vessels with dead weight ranging from 22,000 MT to 35,000 MT and trading worldwide. The operation experience
    has broadened our network and prospective that we are proceeding with further expansion and expecting to acquire additional vessels in the very near future.</p>
